stroke <- stroke[-c(1,376), ] #get rid of dictionary and black row

# E336 (patient 333) and E340 (patient 337) have full date instead of just year
stroke[stroke$id_number == 333, "year_of_birth"] = 1905 #set as 1981 instead of 1905
stroke[stroke$id_number == 337, "year_of_birth"] = 1942
stroke$date_identified = openxlsx::convertToDate(stroke$date_identified)
```
Not sure about error message regarding *Expiration Date* may be because of duplicate rownames. There are two duplicate columns for expiration date 97 and 173
